# Client Access Onboarding Process Improvement

## Overview
This project documents a real-world process improvement initiative led by the Capabilities Team at a healthcare technology organization. The focus was on streamlining the client onboarding process for accessing internal applications—an area previously plagued by long delays, inconsistent workflows, and lack of ownership.

## Problem Statement
Clients experienced long delays and confusion when trying to gain access to business-critical applications. The root causes included fragmented workflows, unclear responsibilities, and lack of standardized documentation and ownership.

## Objectives
- Establish clear ownership and accountability
- Standardize the onboarding process across teams
- Reduce turnaround time and eliminate rework
- Improve transparency for both clients and internal stakeholders

## Key Actions Taken
- Validated the problem via stakeholder questionnaires and team interviews
- Met with departments (IT, Security, Client Services, Ops) to assess risks and gaps
- Created current-state and future-state process maps
- Collaborated with Technical Writing to develop a client-facing SOP
- Built internal playbooks and routing documentation
- Secured leadership approval and implemented the solution
- Published SOP in a shared portal and launched monitoring framework

## Results
| KPI                         | Before                 | After                 |
|----------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|
| Avg. access turnaround     | 5–10 business days     | 2–3 business days     |
| Request rework rate        | ~30%                   | <10%                  |
| Onboarding escalations     | Frequent               | Rare                  |
| Ownership clarity          | Fragmented             | Centralized (Capabilities Team) |

## Future Enhancements
